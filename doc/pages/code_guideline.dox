- Use the provided `.clang-format` to let your code be formatted automatically.
However for example when constructing matrices by rows clang-format tends to
destroy a well looking layout. Feel free to format these parts of your code by
hand.
- Use trailing return types!
- Use right-hand-side `const`s
